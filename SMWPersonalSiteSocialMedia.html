			<br>Regretting Action Is Better Than Regretting Inaction
			<br>
			<br>To me, this means I must take a stand for Equality. 
			<br>It is now 2020, and it is time for humanity to evolve for the benefit of all. 
			<br>
			Social Media helps spread information about everything. It amplifies our voices. We can use this technology to make a positive change by talking about the things that affect us. We must listen to each other, have empathy, and empower each other by lifting each other and rightfully representing minority groups; we can make a good impact on these issues. There are many issues, and they run deep, but we can make a positive impact together.<br>

			<br>As a Professional in the industry, the environment should be my focus. Science, however, is intersectional. Therefore, I have a personal commitment to social justice and activism.

			<br>Thank you, people, who gave your lives in the name of Equality, there are periods of enlightenment that have been happening in our country, and we may have moved to a "post-racial era"â€¦ 
			<br>There is much more work to be done to confront Systemic and Everyday Racism. 
			<br>There must be Justice, Reparations, and accurate, complete Equality.
			<br>I support Black, Indigenous, People of Color's lives.
			<br>For all lives to matter, we must include B.I.P.O.C. (and LGBTQIA+) lives.<br>

		<br>Racism is still embedded deep within systems we are supposed to trust like our
		<br>schools, workplaces, the criminal justice system and hospitals, to name a few. 
		<br>Think about it: because older white people occupy a  number of power positions in our society, it then comes at the expense of people of color.
		<br>disproportionate
		<br> number of power positions in our society, it then comes at the expense of people of color.
		<br>The rich, wealthy, and older patriarchal white supremacist extremist individuals are profiting off the plight of minority groups. We must act against this.
		<br>Anti-racist people do not need to feel guilt or regret for their ancestry, race, identity, etc.
		<br>The point is to uninstall the hate and make the system fair for everyone, and the benefit for everyone exceeds the cost to few.

		Join me on a journey

		<br>the struggle for others based on
		<br>race, sexual orientation and identity, ability, mental health, and the many other issues in our great country, 
		<br>to acknowledge the existence of systemic racism and the implicit biases that all of us carry,

		<br>I am not perfect, and I have made mistakes. We are all valid for our mistakes because they mean that we care enough to make a confident error. Correcting our mistakes, making reparations, and acknowledging the lessons will advance us.
		<br>If I am wrong, I will learn why. The risks are low, and I may be the voice of the majority. 
		<br>
		I am a human who is willing to learn from their mistakes. 
		<br>I acknowledge my mistakes. Please do not sue, fight, hate, nor judge me. I am working on being a better person.
		<br>I have good intentions, and I want to be the right person.
